# DevOps Matrics

* Lead time to develop an application: Helps you understand how quickly you develop applications
* Percentage of failed deployments: Tells you whether they deploy successfully
* Customer ticket volume: Indicates how many issues crop up
* Mean time to recovery: Shows how long it takes to recover from an application bug or failure
* User volume: Indicates how useful your users find your applications

## Lead time to develop

Lead time. A lead time is the latency between the initiation and completion of a process. For example, the 
lead time between the placement of an order and delivery of new cars by a given manufacturer might be between 
2 weeks and 6 months, depending on various particularities.

## Percentage of failed deployments

While a failure rate of 0 is the magic number, less than 5% failed deployments is considered workable. In case the 
metric consistently shows spike of failed deployments over 10%, the existing process needs to be broken down into 
smaller segments with mini-deployments.


## Mean time to recovery
Mean time to recovery (MTTR) is the average time that a device will take to recover from any failure. Examples of 
such devices range from self-resetting fuses (where the MTTR would be very short, probably seconds), up to whole 
systems which have to be repaired or replaced.
