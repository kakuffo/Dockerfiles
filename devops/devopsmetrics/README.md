* Percentage of failed deployments: Tells you whether they deploy successfully
* Customer ticket volume: Indicates how many issues crop up

lead time between the placement of an order and delivery of new cars by a given manufacturer might be between 
2 weeks and 6 months, depending on various particularities.
