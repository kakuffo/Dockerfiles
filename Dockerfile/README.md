# Dockerfiles
The following is an overview of the use of Docker files, and the commands available for creating Docker images, 
which when executed, and instantiated become Docker containers suitable for hosting application.
This document will leverage the official [Docker Docker run reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/),
and illustrate the technique for employing, and using these commands.  This part of my work will create a collection
of DockerFiles for creating a Docker container of the many applications.  These will be used to illustrate my mastery
of DockerFiles !!
